## Comics

- [As You Were](http://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/zines/4710/) - A sweet collection of comics from various authors, mostly about going to punk shows and being indie. I got linked to the one about missing a Mountain Goats concert once, loved it, and then bought this comic at the SF Zinefair. When I found out that the comic I was previously linked to was in it, I was super happy. Highly suggest vol. 1. - [@RichardLitt](https://github.com/RichardLitt)
