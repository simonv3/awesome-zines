## Comics

- [As You Were](http://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/zines/4710/) - A sweet collection of comics from various authors, mostly about going to punk shows and being indie. I got linked to the one about missing a Mountain Goats concert once, loved it, and then bought this comic at the SF Zinefair. When I found out that the comic I was previously linked to was in it, I was super happy. Highly suggest vol. 1. - [@RichardLitt](https://github.com/RichardLitt)
- [Morgenmuffel](http://zinewiki.com/Morgenmuffel) -  This awesome comic zine documents punk, DIY, and anarchist culture in the UK with a mix of adventures and stories about real life. - [@edamamegreen](https://github.com/edamamegreen)

## Poetry

## Prose

- [Ker-bloom!](http://www.booklyn.org/artists/%3Ch2%3EKaren%20Switzer,%20Artnoose%20and%20Kerbloom!,%20Pittsburg,%20PA%3C/h2%3E.php) - I admire artnoose for keeping up this project of printing a letterpress zine every few months for the last decade+. Most are stories from DIY & punk culture, starting in the Bay Area and after moving to Pittsburgh. I am glad the author shared her stories later in the series about the process of becoming a mother as a single woman â€” a choice to separate having a child from having a relationship that produces a child. - [@edamamegreen](https://github.com/edamamegreen)
